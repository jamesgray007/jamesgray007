Hi, this is James Gray! As a Data and AI Leader with over thirty years of technology experience, including a decade at Microsoft, I partner with innovative organizations as a fractional leader and trusted advisor to leverage data, AI, and leadership capabilities for a competitive edge. 

In addition to my work with organizations, I am an instructor for data and artificial intelligence strategy at the Berkeley Haas School of Business.

I earned an MBA and Master of Information and Data Science from the University of California, Berkeley, and a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from Union College. I also hold a Brown University Leadership and Performance Coaching certification, which empowers me to develop leaders and high-performance teams.
